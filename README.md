# c-maze-game-

In this c++ project i make a mazegame. There are 2 players and one diamond. The player L with green color moves with the arrows from the user. The player M with the red color moves randomly. The player who reach the diamond first wins the game. Also, with the "space" the player L doesn't move but the player M continues to move randomly. The map of the maze was created in txt by me.
